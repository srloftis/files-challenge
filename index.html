		<h1>Treebeard</h1>

		<p>Treebeard is an Ent who lives in Fangorn Forest. You can tell he doesn't get out very much because he doesn't know the difference between hobbits and orcs.
		There are no Entlings in the forest because the Ents lost the Entwives, so Treebeard should really look into having a Hufflepuff find them for him. Despite his flaws,
		you have to admire Treebeard's dedication to meaningful conversation. He doesn't waste time with small talk, because "it takes a long time to say anything in Old Entish. And we never 
		say anything unless it is worth taking a long time to say." </p>
